--------------------

# Desc

Deploy illa utils manually. Docker, docker compose and k8s are all avaliable in this repo.  

Note:

We highly recommended deploying with our auto-deploy tools [illa-cli](https://github.com/illacloud/illa).

And for the moment we do not support Apple Silicon M1 (darwin-arm64 arch).
